# AI-for-Iris-Photos-Editing-Automation
Seeking to create a web/app solution that automates iris photo editing using AI technology. The project involves developing features for detection or the iris, editing, generation of special effects and backgrounds. The ideal candidate will ensure the application is scalable and user-friendly, catering to both professional and casual users.
Strong experience in AI/ML integration, image processing, photo editing and software development is required.

More details:
• Develop an application or web-based interface to automate iris photo editing.
• Integrate AI models for iris detection in high resolution iris photos, edit, apply special effects, and generate background.
• Ensure the software is scalable, fast, and easy to use

Workflow description:
Developing or integrating AI models into the Iris photography workflow, by fully automating the editing of iris photos, including segmentation of the eye and the iris, detection and isolation of the iris, enhancement of the iris photo, and compositing with creative effects and backgrounds.
1. Detecting and cropping the iris area automatically using a trained AI model. Precisely detecting and segmenting the iris from the eye, making it easier to apply specific effects.
2. After isolating the iris, automatically enhance the iris details (enhancing contrast, sharpening, removing ambient and flash reflection), and maintaining a high resolution images of the iris.
3. Integrating the isolated and optimized iris image with creative and diverse backgrounds. Backgrounds can be generated based on user inputs or predefined background themes and effects.
4. Appling artistic effects and merging them with the background based on different predefined or user generated artistic themes while preserving key iris features and details.
5. Generating the final output in high resolution, with options for users to preview and select different background styles.
All these tools must be integrated into a workflow to automate iris photo editing and production of high quality images in different dimensions and sizes.

Requirements:
• AI/ML developers to design and train custom machine learning models
• Expertise in AI, image processing, and software development.
• Computer Vision Experts to create algorithms that can isolate the iris in images and apply transformations to enhance or modify them.
• Full-stack developers to integrate the AI models into a user-friendly platform

===========================
Creating a solution to automate iris photo editing using AI technology requires a combination of expertise in AI/ML, computer vision, image processing, and full-stack development. Below is an outline of the Python-based architecture that can serve as the foundation for this project.

This modular approach will involve several components:

    Backend for AI Model Inference
    Frontend for User Interaction
    AI Models for Detection and Enhancement
    Integration with Image Effects and Backgrounds

Python Code: Backend with Flask and Integration

Here is an example Python code for the backend API to handle iris detection, enhancement, and integration with effects.
Backend - Flask API

import os
import cv2
import numpy as np
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, send_file
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from PIL import Image, ImageEnhance, ImageFilter
import uuid

# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Load pre-trained AI models
iris_detection_model = load_model("models/iris_detection_model.h5")
iris_enhancement_model = load_model("models/iris_enhancement_model.h5")

# Function for iris detection
def detect_iris(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    image_resized = cv2.resize(gray, (128, 128)) / 255.0  # Resize for model
    image_resized = np.expand_dims(image_resized, axis=(0, -1))  # Add batch and channel dims
    mask = iris_detection_model.predict(image_resized)[0, :, :, 0]  # Predict mask
    mask = (mask > 0.5).astype(np.uint8) * 255  # Binarize
    return mask

# Function for iris enhancement
def enhance_iris(image_path, mask):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    mask = cv2.resize(mask, (image.shape[1], image.shape[0]))  # Resize mask to original image size
    mask = np.expand_dims(mask, axis=-1)
    enhanced = iris_enhancement_model.predict(np.expand_dims(image * mask, axis=0))[0]
    return (enhanced * 255).astype(np.uint8)

# Function to apply artistic effects
def apply_artistic_effects(image, effect_type="blur"):
    pil_image = Image.fromarray(image)
    if effect_type == "blur":
        pil_image = pil_image.filter(ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(5))
    elif effect_type == "sharpen":
        enhancer = ImageEnhance.Sharpness(pil_image)
        pil_image = enhancer.enhance(2.0)
    return np.array(pil_image)

# Function to generate a new background
def generate_background(style="gradient", size=(500, 500)):
    if style == "gradient":
        background = np.zeros((size[0], size[1], 3), dtype=np.uint8)
        for i in range(size[1]):
            color = int(255 * (i / size[1]))
            background[:, i] = [color, 0, 255 - color]
        return background
    else:
        # Return solid background by default
        return np.full((size[0], size[1], 3), 128, dtype=np.uint8)

# API Route for Iris Editing
@app.route("/edit-iris", methods=["POST"])
def edit_iris():
    if "image" not in request.files:
        return jsonify({"error": "No image file provided"}), 400
    
    image_file = request.files["image"]
    effect_type = request.form.get("effect", "blur")
    background_style = request.form.get("background", "gradient")

    # Save uploaded file temporarily
    temp_filename = f"temp_{uuid.uuid4().hex}.png"
    image_file.save(temp_filename)

    # Step 1: Detect Iris
    mask = detect_iris(temp_filename)

    # Step 2: Enhance Iris
    enhanced_iris = enhance_iris(temp_filename, mask)

    # Step 3: Apply Artistic Effects
    artistic_iris = apply_artistic_effects(enhanced_iris, effect_type)

    # Step 4: Generate Background
    background = generate_background(style=background_style)

    # Step 5: Composite Iris with Background
    background = cv2.resize(background, artistic_iris.shape[:2][::-1])
    composite = cv2.addWeighted(artistic_iris, 0.7, background, 0.3, 0)

    # Save final output
    output_filename = f"output_{uuid.uuid4().hex}.png"
    cv2.imwrite(output_filename, composite)

    # Clean up temp file
    os.remove(temp_filename)

    return send_file(output_filename, mimetype="image/png")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)

Key Features in the Code:

    Iris Detection:
        Uses a pre-trained deep learning model to detect and isolate the iris area.
        Outputs a binary mask.

    Iris Enhancement:
        Uses a separate model for enhancing iris details.
        Removes reflections and improves sharpness.

    Artistic Effects:
        Applies artistic effects like blurring or sharpening to the isolated iris.

    Background Generation:
        Generates a gradient background or a solid color for compositing.

    Integration:
        Combines the enhanced iris with the background and allows the user to download the final image.

To create a web-based interface, consider using React or Vue.js for a user-friendly frontend that allows:

    Uploading iris images.
    Selecting artistic effects and backgrounds.
    Previewing the final image.
    Downloading the processed photo.
